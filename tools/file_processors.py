    !! IMPORTANT HARD TRUTH !!
    This is a placeholder. Real-world OCR is complex. To make this work reliably,
    you would need to replace the logic here with a call to a powerful vision model
    like Gemini 1.5 Pro's native vision capabilities or a dedicated OCR API.
    The agent's LLM is a language model, not a vision model, so it cannot "see" the image itself.
    This tool's job is to be its eyes.

    # In a real implementation, you would do this:
    # 1. Load the image using a library like Pillow.
    # 2. Encode the image (e.g., to base64).
    # 3. Send it to a multimodal model API (like the Gemini API with an image input).
    # 4. Parse the numeric reading from the model's response.
    #
    # For now, this tool will return a fixed value and a warning.
